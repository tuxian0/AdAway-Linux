# AdAway-Linux
Linux AdAway installer and updater

This tool is used to update the hosts file to block adds. Make sure you took backup of the original hosts file before executing this script. This script will append the ad-sites along with the existing content. So that, I asked you to keep a copy of that hosts file in current execution directory.

To Install:
1) Copy /etc/hosts to current directory where updateAdAway-hosts.sh is downloaded
2) sh updateAdAway-hosts.sh
